## Getting Started

To get this typing speed tester up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

You'll need Python installed on your system. This project is compatible with Python 3.x.

### Installation

1.  *Clone the repository (or download the source code):*
    If you're using Git, you can clone the repository to your local machine:

    bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_folder>
    

    (Replace <repository_url> and <repository_folder> with the actual URL and folder name if this were a public repository.)

2.  *Ensure Tkinter is available:*
    Tkinter usually comes pre-installed with Python. If you encounter any issues, you might need to install it separately, depending on your operating system:

      * *For Debian/Ubuntu:*
        bash
        sudo apt-get install python3-tk
        
      * *For Fedora:*
        bash
        sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
        
      * *For Windows/macOS:*
        Tkinter is typically included with the standard Python installation from python.org.

### Running the Application

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the Python script:

bash
python your_script_name.py


(Replace your_script_name.py with the actual name of your Python file, e.g., Typing_speed_tester.py)
